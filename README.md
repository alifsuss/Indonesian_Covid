# Indonesian_Covid
This sript was written by me to see the relationship between testing and covid cases to see whether there is a relation between the two. 
The data were collected from: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ma1T9hWbec1pXlwZ89WakRk-OfVUQZsOCFl4FwZxzVw/htmlview# but indirectly.
Some update will be carried out for automatic data collection.
If you execute the script, you will get the result as in the figure. It still show relationship between the cases&theSpecimen Tested.
The best would be the to has no relation, or S-curve at the end of the letter, meaning no matter how many test the results still showing a constat value.
Stay Safe!
